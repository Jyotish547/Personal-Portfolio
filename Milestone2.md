1. I created my project using Vitejs bundler instead of Webpack as I was unable to load the TypeScript file that I was using and figuring out why was the most time (around 8 hours. I was fixated on using webpack until I realized that wasn't happening for some reason) taking but in the end I decided to go with Vitejs and it's working very well.
2. I am using tailwincss for my CSS components. For animations, I plan on using Framer Motion after I complete the basic structure of the whole Portfolio.
3. I haven't integrated any JS Libraries yet, but I plan to do so very soon.
4. I have not finalized the color scheme yet, I feel that it would be quite easy later on when I decide on what palette would be best suitable for me.
5. I plan on designing a logo for my Portfolio, but that will be at the last stage.
6. There are some minor issues I am facing like importing an image, and improper sizing of the portfolio as a whole.
