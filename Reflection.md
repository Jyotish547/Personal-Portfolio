In creating my portfolio, I wanted to show off my UI/UX, Front-End, and Graphic Design skills in a way that was both beautiful and easy to use. I chose to use Anime.js and p5.js to make the website more interactive and visually interesting, especially in the main sections.

On the technical side, this project was challenging but taught me a lot. I focused on making the website work well on different devices, using CSS Flexbox and Grid. I planned to add a light and dark mode toggle, but this turned out to be harder than expected and is something I still need to work on.

**Timeline and Milestones:**

My initial plan was quite ambitious. I wanted to have a basic site with three projects showcased right away, but so far, I've only been able to add one. This means I've had to extend my timeline to add more content.

**Challenges and Learnings:**

Making the site work well on mobile devices was tough and taught me a lot about responsive design. Also, using new JavaScript libraries like Anime.js and p5.js was challenging but helped me improve my skills.

**New Tools and Takeaways:**

This project introduced me to new tools like Anime.js, p5.js and tailwindcss, which are now important parts of my toolkit. It showed me how important it is to keep learning and adapting in front-end development.

**Overall Takeaways:**

Building my portfolio has been a mix of creativity, technical challenges, and learning. It's taught me to set realistic goals and be flexible. Even though I didn't meet all my initial goals on time, I've made good progress and learned a lot, which shows in my work and growth as a designer and developer.
